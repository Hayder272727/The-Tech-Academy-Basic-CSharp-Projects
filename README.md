This repository contains all of the coding projects I completed during the Basic C# Course at The  Academy of  learning .
It includes exercises, mini-projects, and assignments created while learning:

C# syntax and programming fundamentals

Variables, data types, and operators

Methods and classes

Object-oriented programming

Debugging and error handling

Loops and conditional statements

Working with Visual Studio and .NET

As I progress through the course, I will continue updating this repository with new projects and improvements.# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-CSharp-Projects
